# Rwanda Neighborhood Map

## Quick Start

Fork this folder, go to the src or dist folder and serve it. You can use python on the command line for example:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Open localhost:8000 in a web browser and the page should open!

## Usage

This app gives you the possibility to explore places I liked when I visited Rwanda a few years ago.

You can also add your own places, but only if they are located in Rwanda!

## Context
